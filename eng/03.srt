1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,210
Before we proceed any further, 

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:08,140
it's important that you understand the difference between the pure and impure functions. 

3
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:16,190
The pure functions are the functions whose returned value depends solely on the values of their arguments.

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:20,350
Pure functions do not have any observable side effects,

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,130
such as network or database calls.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,560
The pure functions just calculate the new value.

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,510
You can be confident that if you call the pure function

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,050
with the same set of arguments,

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,740
you're going to get the same returned value.

10
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,180
They are predictable.

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,330
Also, pure functions do not modify the values passed to them.

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:43,320
For example,

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:49,200
squareAll function that accepts an array does not overwrite the items inside this array.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,070
Instead, it returns a new array by using items map.

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,260
On the opposite,

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,640
impure functions may call the database or the network,

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,550
they may have side effects, 

18
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,310
they may operate on the DOM, 

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,920
and they may override the values that you pass to them.

20
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,780
This is going to be an important distinction

21
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:16,280
because some of the functions that you're going to write in Redux have to be pure,

22
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
and you need to be mindful of that.
