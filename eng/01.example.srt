00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:02,420
The first principle of Redux

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:06,850
is whether your app is a really simple one like this counter example,

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
or a complex application with a lot of UI, and change of state,

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
you are going to represent the whole state of your application as a single JavaScript object.
