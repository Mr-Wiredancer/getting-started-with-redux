In the last few lessons, we created a user interface for a simple React and Redux todo list where I can add items, toggle them as completed, and change the currently visible todos.

And we did that by having a single "TodoApp" component that has the input, the button for adding todos, the list of currently visible todos with click handler. And it has these three links that let us change the currently visible todos.

The single component approach worked so far. However, we really want to have many components that can be used, tested, and changed by different people separately. So we're going to refactor our application in this lesson.

The first component I want to extract from the "TodoApp" component is the "Todo" component that renders a single list item. I am declaring the "Todo" component as a function which React 14 allows me to do. I'm not sure which props it's going to have, so I'll leave them blank for now. And I will just paste the list item I copied before.

The first thing I'm doing is removing the special "key" property because it's only needed when I enumerate an array. And I'll use it later when enumerating many todos.

One of my goals with this refactoring is to make every component as flexible as it is reasonable. Right now, I have hardcoded that clicking a todo always causes the "TOGGLE_TODO" action. And this is perfectly fine to do in your app.

However, I prefer to have a bunch of components that don't specify any behaviors, and that are only concerned with how things look or how they render. I call such components the presentational components.

I would like to give todo a presentational component, so I removed the "onClick" handler. And I promote it to be a prop so that anyone who uses "Todo" component can specify what happens on the click. And you don't have to do this in your Redux apps, but I find it to be a very convenient pattern.

Finally, while it doesn't make a lot of difference, I prefer to keep it explicit what is the data that the component needs to render. So instead of passing a todo object, I pass "completed" and "text" fields as separate props.

Note how the "Todo" component is now a purely presentational component and doesn't specify any behavior. But it knows how to render "ADD_TODO".

The next component I create is called "TodoList". And it's also a presentational component. It's only concerned with how things look.

And it accepts an array of todos. And it's going to render an unordered list of them by calling the "todos.map" function and rendering a "Todo" component for every todo. It tells React to use todo ID as the unique key for the elements. And it spreads over the "todo" object properties so the "text" and "completed" end up as props on the "Todo" component.

Now I need to specify what happens when a todo is clicked. And I could have dispatched an action here. And again, that would be fine, but I want it to a presentational component, so I'm going to call another function, called "onTodoClick", and pass the ID of the todo, and let it decide what should happen. So "onTodoClick" is another prop for the "TodoList".

Both "Todo" and "TodoList" are presentational components, so we need something I call, "container components" to actually pass the data from the store and to specify the behavior. In this case, the top level "TodoAppComponent" acts as a container component. And We will see more examples of container components in the future lessons.

In this case, it just renders the "TodoList" with visible todos as the "todos", and with a callback that says that when "onTodoClick" is called with a todo ID, we should dispatch an action on the store with the type "TOGGLE_TODO" and the ID of the todo.

Let's recap again how this works. The "TodoApp" component renders a "TodoList", and it passes a function to it that can dispatch an action. The "TodoList" component renders the "Todo" component and passes "onClick" prop which calls "onTodoClick".

The "Todo" component just uses the "onClick" prop it receives and binds it to the list item's "onClick". This way, when it's called, the "onTodoClick" is called, and this dispatches the action and updates the visible todos because the action updates the store.
